# This code randomly generates 'coin flips' until heads or tails comes up three
# times in a row.  When that happens, it records the amount of flips in a total
# and proceeds to do it amount - 1 more times. After 100,000 times, it converges
# on 7.  I had 6.99984 on my PC, wonder how many times that would occur?
